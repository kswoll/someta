# Samples

Aside from the trivial examples already described in the sections on each extension point, these are some more fully featured examples that you might want to actually use.

* [Memoize](Memoize.md)
* [Reactive](Reactive.md)
* [ObservableAsProperty](https://github.com/kswoll/someta/wiki/ObservableAsProperty)
* [Unnullable](https://github.com/kswoll/someta/wiki/Unnullable-properties)
* [NotifyPropertyChanged](NonPublicAccessExample) (This was actually the example for the state extension point)
