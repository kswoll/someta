# Samples

Aside from the trivial examples already described in the sections on each extension point, these are some more fully featured examples that you might want to actually use.

* [Memoize](Memoize.md)
* [Reactive](Reactive.md)
* [ObservableAsProperty](ObservableAsProperty.md)
* [Unnullable](Unnullable.md)
* [NotifyPropertyChanged](/Someta.Docs/ExtensionPoints/NonPublicAccess.md) (This was actually the example for the state extension point)
