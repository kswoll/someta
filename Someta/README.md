# Someta

This project contains the interfaces and attributes you need to reference in order to define your
extension point attributes.  This project must be directly referenced by any project of yours that
makes use of this library.  In contrast, the `Someta.Fody` assembly should never be referenced by
your projects, and exists to facilitate the Fody process that rewrites your assemblies.
